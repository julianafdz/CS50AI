# Heredity

Write an AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait. These relationships are modeled by forming a Bayesian Network of all the relevant variables.

Given information about people, who their parents are, and whether they have a particular observable trait caused by a given gene, the AI infer the probability distribution for each personâ€™s genes, as well as the probability distribution for whether any person will exhibit the trait in question.
