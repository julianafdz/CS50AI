# Minesweeper

Write an AI to play Minesweeper.

## Propositional Logic and Knowledge Representation

The goal of this project was to build an AI that can play Minesweeper. knowledge-based agents make decisions by considering their knowledge base, and making inferences based on that knowledge, we achieved this by making each cell a propositional variable that is true if the cell contains a mine, and false otherwise.
